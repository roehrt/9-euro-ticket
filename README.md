# 9 € Ticket

This simple tool helps to find cheaper connections for long-distance travels with Deutsche Bahn (DB)
if you have a 9 € ticket using the fact that you are allowed to use regional traffic in whole Germany
for free. So even if you don't own a 9 € Ticket yet, it often saves money to buy the ticket for only
one journey!
