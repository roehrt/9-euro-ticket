# 9 € Ticket

## Background

From June on Germany offers a “9 for 90” ticket, which is primarily intended to inspire more people to use public transport and offers free use of public transport for 90 days for 9 € monthly (so 27 € for all 90 days). However, while it's primarily intended for regional transport, it can also be useful for long-distance travels. In fact: you can strip of all regional traffic at the beginning and end of the journey.

## Downsides

In case of delay of the regional traffic, one has then no right to compensation.
